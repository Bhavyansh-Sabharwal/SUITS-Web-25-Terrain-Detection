## 1. Background

```
NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface
Technologies for Students) is a
software design challenge in which
college students from across the
country help design solutions for
future spaceflight needs. NASA’s
Artemis missions seek to land the first
woman and first person of color on
the Moon, as well as build towards a
sustained human presence on the
Moon and, ultimately, Mars. This
means engineers are actively developing technologies needed to assure successful completion of
science and exploration missions. Created as a collaboration between the Extravehicular Activity and
Human Surface Mobility Program (EHP) and the Office of STEM Engagement, NASA SUITS is entering its
eighth year of connecting students to authentic engineering challenges.
```
```
A sustained human presence on the lunar surface will require us to reimagine how spacewalks are
conducted. This includes digital information in the form of displays and interoperability between
spacesuits and rovers. NASA will also need to use artificial intelligence and edge computing to reach our
full exploration potential.
```
```
In NASA SUITS, we expect teams to design a crew autonomy enabling system and user interface (UI).
Teams will submit a proposal for both spacesuit and pressurized rover (PR) systems and displays. If
selected, we will assign teams one of the two assets to focus on. We will then match these teams with
other teams to demonstrate the interoperability of the lunar assets. Teams may design their spacesuit
display with their choice of device, however, any HMDs (head-mounted displays) for the spacesuit must
be passthrough augmented reality. The pressurized rover is virtual and operates in a virtual
environment, integrating NASA’s Digital Lunar Exploration Sites Unreal Simulation Tool (DUST).
```
```
Student teams who submit the top proposals will be selected to develop an interface and background
software, be mentored by NASA experts, and test their devices in a mock EVA (extravehicular activity)
scenario at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, in May 2025, where they will showcase their work
to NASA engineers.
```

## 2. Mission Concept

```
NASA SUITS is creating a lunar EVA
scenario for 2025. Teams are
responsible for their UI, display
device, and background software.
Testing will take place after dark at
the JSC Rock Yard. Therefore, teams
will need to accommodate for
lighting factors in the display
systems, especially if they use an
HMD. The rockyard consists of a
pulverized granite base with scoria
boulders up to 1m and craters up to
2m deep and 20m in diameter.
```
```
The scenario takes place with two teams participating at a time, with each assigned to either the
pressurized rover or the spacesuit components. Each team will have their own design objectives but will
need to work together throughout the challenge to meet interoperability goals.
```
```
Each team will be connected to a telemetry stream specific to their assigned lunar asset. Teams will
need to coordinate with their partnered team to develop an interoperability system, independent of the
assigned telemetry, which enables the sharing of information and data with each other.
```
### 2a. Pressurized Rover

```
The Pressurized Rover team will need to develop a display and control system for the rover operating in
the virtual DUST environment. We are specifically looking for the teams to use autonomous systems as
they navigate the rover from one location to another.
```
### 2b. Spacesuit

```
The spacesuit team will need to deploy their solution for two EVA crewmembers. This solution can be
two of the same device or two different devices. For example, two HMDs, two tablets, or one of each. If
this will create an undue burden on a team, we can work with them post-selection on an alternative
solution. The EVA crewmembers will be referred to as “EV,” or “EV1” and “EV2” if differentiated.
```
### 2c. Mission Tasks

#### Rover Navigation

```
The scenario begins with the PR team demonstrating their display and crew autonomy system as they
navigate the rover from a starting location to the designated worksite(s).
```
```
PR features evaluated at this point include autonomous best path planning, hazard avoidance,
consumable resource usage, and estimates of remaining resources when the destination is reached.
Additionally, teams should provide estimates of turn around points at which the rover will need to
```

return to base or risk depletion of limited resources. When provided with a point of interest, teams
should use predictive modeling to provide a decision support system for crew to optimize resource
usage and reduce cognitive load.

At a certain point, the team will receive notification that a simulated Lunar Terrain Vehicle has identified
an area of geologic interest. The PR team will then navigate to that location.

Upon arrival, the crewmembers will prepare for egress. The Umbilical Interface Assembly (UIA) will be
part of the airlock in the PR. Therefore, the consumables used to prepare the spacesuit will be taken
from the PR’s resources and should be taken into consideration.

The crewmember in the PR will also support the EVs as they proceed through the rest of the scenario.

Please reference the requirements section for more detailed PR system implementation requirements.

#### Egress

Egress occurs when the crewmembers exit the airlock to begin
the EVA. Several steps must take place inside the airlock to
ensure the crewmember can safely egress.

The goal of this task is to demonstrate effective and efficient
methods for completing the UIA procedures used to initiate an
EVA by preparing and checking the spacesuit’s portable life
support systems.

The EV will use information from their display to complete
procedures for the UIA. The EV will interface with tactile switches
on the UIA in accordance with provided procedures. Upon
successful completion of the egress task, the EV will move on to
the navigation portion of the EVA.

Teams decide the most effective method for communicating and accomplishing these procedures. This
can be a text checklist, computer vision, voice commands, a combination, or none of those listed. The
UIA’s switch state will be provided by the PR’s Telemetry Stream Server (TSS) which should be accessible
to the EV via interoperability. A sample of procedures is in Appendix A but is subject to change as we
approach test week.


#### EV Navigation

The purpose of EV navigation is to ensure
the crewmember(s) can traverse between
stations safely and efficiently. The goal is to
implement a software system for tracking
crew and scientific assets in the field, as
well as aid crew members as they navigate
the lunar surface. This includes a system for
detecting and navigating environmental
hazards under lighting conditions like what
you might experience at the lunar south
pole. An animation of sample lighting conditions is available here. The system should provide real-time
alerts and recommend immediate actions such as alternate routes.

Upon completion of each task, the EV will walk from their current station to the next designated station.
The EV will use information provided in their display to physically navigate between these stations.

Teams will design a navigation solution that is effective and non-obtrusive. This navigation solution
needs to allow for flexibility in the EVA as destinations can change. For the UI, teams shall design a 2D
mini-map navigation aid. Teams may also include a 3D map, computer vision destination waypoints,
and/or path indicators.

Throughout all aspects of the EVA, the crewmember should be able to use interoperability features with
the PR.

#### Geologic Sampling

The UIs will also help meet science objectives. Teams will achieve this by collecting samples with both
human and robotic assets. The goal of this task is to demonstrate how your system can increase
crewmember efficiency and reduce cognitive load.

The EV will use a simulated XRF (X-ray Fluorescence) spectroscopy sensor to scan the chemical make-up
of rock samples for potential collection. The EV will scan several samples and perform collection tasks of
desired samples.

This mock XRF sensor uses RFID (radio frequency identification) of selected samples sent to the TSS,
which then sends XRF data to the user. Teams should access and display this data as they see fit. We
recommend researching field geology techniques and integrating them into the concept and data
collection model. Teams may choose to use The Look ODD Process. Interoperability would allow the PR
to view data as it is collected.

#### Ingress

An EVA is not complete until the crewmember has arrived safely back inside their spacecraft or habitat.
Ingress is the process of returning to the airlock. Once the crewmember has completed all EVA tasks,
they will begin the ingress portion of the EVA.


```
Upon completion of the final task of the EVA, the EV will begin ingress. The EV will follow navigation
cues and instructions to follow the best path for return to the airlock. The EV will conduct final
procedures with UIA when they arrive to the airlock.
```
```
Teams will decide the most effective method for navigating back to the airlock. The UI shall provide a
“breadcrumbs” feature for retracing a path. The ideal implementation would provide the shortest, safe
path back to the airlock.
```
## 3. NASA Provided Systems and Equipment

### 3a. TSS

```
The TSS is a server that provides simulated telemetry values for each of the lunar assets. This stream is
divided into two feeds, and each team will have access to a specific feed, as detailed in the table below.
To achieve interoperability goals, teams will need to coordinate the transfer of telemetry across assets.
```
```
NASA will provide a Unity/Unreal plugin to assist in integrating the TSS with your project. Your device
must be able to retrieve the following information from the TSS and display it at any time:
```
```
Telemetry feed to Pressurized Rover Telemetry feed to EV/Spacesuit
```
- Pressurized Rover telemetry
- Lunar Terrain Vehicle telemetry
- UIA
    - Spacesuit telemetry
    - XRF Spectrometer
    - Display Control Unit (DCU)

### 3b. UIA

```
The UIA features multiple switches that teams will manipulate to match the desired configuration for
egress. These switches feed into the telemetry stream via Booleans, allowing teams to receive real-time
feedback on their position. We encourage teams to explore creative solutions to display procedures,
computer vision, and telemetry representation to assist in completing the procedures. UIA telemetry
will be provided to the PR, which will in turn share the data with the spacesuit via interoperability built
by the teams.
```
### 3c. Spectrometer.......................................................................................................................................

```
NASA provides the simulated XRF spectrometer, which selects
simulated geological data from a database when a rock with an RFID
tag is scanned. The geological data is then sent via the telemetry
stream back to the user. The team will display the geological data of
each rock as part of their geology sampling procedures and data
collection. XRF telemetry will be provided to the spacesuit, which will
in turn share the data with PR via interoperability built by the teams.
```

### 3d. Lunar Terrain Vehicle

```
NASA will provide the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) and framework for the LTV to move through the
terrain of the test site. The team is responsible for receiving and displaying telemetry from the PR TSS
for the LTV.
```
### 3e. Display and Control Unit

```
The Display and Control Unit (DCU) features multiple switches which allow the EV to interact with
different systems of the space suit. These switches feed into the telemetry stream, allowing teams to
receive real-time feedback on their position. The DCU also allows the EV to handle any errors related to
these systems. The version provided does not have an integrated display, rather your spacesuit display
will handle this information via the TSS.
```
```
The systems controlled by the DCU include:
```
- Battery (Local/UMB)
- Oxygen (Pri/Sec)
- Comms (A/B)
    - Fan (Pri/Sec)
    - Pump (Open/Close)
    - CO2 (A/B)

```
The DCU contains a Raspberry Pi with a positioning system. The team is responsible for displaying the
information given to them via the telemetry stream. NASA will provide a method for simulating the DCU
location system to assist with the teams’ development.
```
